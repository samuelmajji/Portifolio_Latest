        Iâ€™m Samuel Majji, a third-year Tech-Electrical undergraduate at&nbsp;
        <span className="text-white">IIT Tirupati</span>. My coding journey
        began with the&nbsp;
        <span className="text-white">100 Days of Code</span> Python bootcamp,
        which helped me build a strong base in problem-solving and
        object-oriented programming. Over time, I transitioned into full-stack
        development, learning to build web apps using&nbsp;
        <span className="text-white">Flask, React, and Node.js</span>, and
        databases like&nbsp;
        <span className="text-white">MongoDB</span> and&nbsp;

        I've built and shipped projects like a virtual coffee machine, a blog
        website, a sticky-notes app, and a college

        the
        <span className="text-white"> SAC website</span> for my institute and
        helped build the
        <span className="text-white"> 3D Tirutsava fest website</span>. My
        favorite experience so far was developing an interactive terrain-based
        spaceship game using&nbsp;
        <span className="text-white">Three.js</span> and&nbsp;
